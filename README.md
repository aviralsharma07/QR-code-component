## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Netlify

### What I learned

1. Importing Font Styles to CSS File
2. Write clean code and don't use 'div' if not necessary.
3. Limiting Body Height using `vh` and use min-height.
4. use `weight` instead of `b` for Text.
5. Prefer using **px** for Border Radius than **%**


### Continued development

Moving ahead, I want to create more complex projects by improving grasp on Flexbox, positioning and typography. I'll be exploring Mobile first approach to make my projects highly responsive. I will revise and use Box-Model i.e, Padding and Margin to my advantage in next projects.
